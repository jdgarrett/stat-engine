To determine COVID-19 related calls, you must first determine the filter you need to apply.  See this [blog post](https://medium.com/statengine/case-study-coronavirus-covid-19-dashboard-in-nfors-statengine-f9093a73b42a) for a detailed description and examples.  One such filter might be `description.comments is \\\"covid\\\"`.\\n2.  Apply the filter at the Dashboard level to filter your view to COVID-19 related calls.\\n3.  You can further filter the data by interacting with other visualization such as clicking a bar on the *Incidents by First Due* visualization.  \\n\\n\\n**Going forward, please consider adding a distinct dispatch call type, or additional field identifiers in CAD to include Contagious Emergency, COVID-19, or similar.  This change will make this call type a first class data element so that you can use the information to assure adequate resources for your department.**\\n\\n# Additional Related Resources\\n\\n1.
